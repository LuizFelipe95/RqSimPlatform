RQ-HYPOTHESIS STAGE 4: INTERNAL OBSERVER
================================================================================
Date: 2024
Status: IMPLEMENTED

OVERVIEW:
---------
This stage introduces relational measurement through an internal observer
subsystem. Instead of external "God's eye view" measurements, the observer
is a designated region of the graph that becomes entangled with the system
being measured.

NEW FILES CREATED:
------------------
1. RQSimulation\Quantum\Measurement\InternalObserver.cs
   - InternalObserver class - core observer implementation
   - ObservationRecord struct - single measurement record
   - ObservationStatistics struct - summary statistics

2. RQSimulation\Quantum\Measurement\RQGraph.InternalObserver.cs
   - Partial class with RQGraph integration methods
   - GetNodePhase(), ShiftNodePhase(), GetNodeWavefunction()
   - ConfigureInternalObserver(), GetInternallyObservedEnergy()

3. RqSimGPUCPUTests\Tests\InternalObserver\InternalObserver_Tests.cs
   - 25 unit tests for the new functionality

EXISTING FILES PRESERVED (NOT MODIFIED):
----------------------------------------
- RQSimulation\Analysis\Statistics\RQGraph.Statistics.cs
  All existing statistics methods remain unchanged.
  
- RQSimulation\Quantum\Measurement\RQGraph.Measurement.cs
  All existing measurement methods remain unchanged.

KEY NEW METHODS IN RQGraph:
---------------------------
- ConfigureInternalObserver(nodes, seed) - set up observer subsystem
- ConfigureInternalObserverAuto(size, seed) - auto-select low-degree nodes
- DisableInternalObserver() - return to legacy mode
- GetInternallyObservedEnergy() - RQ-compliant energy measurement
- GetNodePhase(nodeId) - get wavefunction phase
- ShiftNodePhase(nodeId, delta) - apply phase rotation
- GetNodeWavefunction(nodeId) - get wavefunction value
- GetObserverMutualInformation(targets) - correlation measure

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
-----------------------
- _internalObserver = null by default (legacy behavior preserved)
- All existing statistics methods work without modification
- GetInternallyObservedEnergy() falls back to ComputeNetworkHamiltonian()
  when no observer is configured

PHYSICS NOTES:
--------------
In relational quantum mechanics, measurement is an interaction that creates
correlation (entanglement) between observer and system. The "result" is 
encoded in the relative phase between subsystems, not extracted to external
classical variables.

This implementation:
1. Observer nodes form a designated subsystem
2. Measurement creates phase correlations via ApplyControlledPhase()
3. Results are "recorded" in observer's phase, not external variables
4. Mutual information quantifies how much information observer has extracted
